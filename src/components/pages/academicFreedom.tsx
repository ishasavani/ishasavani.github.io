        To me, academic freedom is questioning existing structures and norms in which we find ourselves operating- social, political, cultural and/or other. Academic freedom is synonymous to investigating the truth, it is an enabler to getting to the bottom of things, enquiring to get to the truth, and articulating this enquiry in writings and dialogues. Ultimately academic freedom goes beyond intellectual exercises and enables working collaboratively towards alternative ways of being, more socially just ways of being. In practice, this translates into campaighing for political prisoners in India, investigating land-rights movements, engaging with indigenous communities on concepts of stress, time and relationship to nature, and challenging the reticence to race education in American univeristies. Selected engagements are mentioned below:

            Conference: Lessons in Indigeneity
          </span>
          <br />
          I co-hosted a confrence which brought together Scandinavian indigenous community (Sami) together with indigenous communities from Jharkhand India (Munda and Oraon). The talks and dialogues brought out similarities in historical colonization and forms of present day soft and/or direct violence experienced, in particular, by members of these communities. Land rights (Fosen windmill case in Norway and Netarhat movement in India) and the meaning of solidarity were recurring themes around which discussions and exchange of histories took place
            throughout the confrence.
