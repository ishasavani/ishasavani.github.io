        Civic engagement allows the coming together of different perspectives in
        order to better understand the various dimensions of a problem of common
        interest or concern. In the context of availability and distribution of
        critical resources such as water, I work with other academics,
        interested members of the community, governments and industries so that
        the social, political, economical and scientific dimensions of the
        problem can be better understood. This engagement inevitably leads to
        informing my research methodology and bridging the gap between
        theoretical knowledge and the reality of the ground. Selected avenues of
        engagement are mentioned below:
