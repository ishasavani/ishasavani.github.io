          <br />
          To me, academic freedom is questioning existing structures and norms
          in which we find ourselves operating- social, political, cultural
          and/or other. Academic freedom is synonymous to investigating the
          truth, it is an enabler to getting to the bottom of things, enquiring
          to get to the truth, and articulating this enquiry in writings and
          dialogues. Ultimately academic freedom goes beyond intellectual
          exercises and enables working collaboratively towards alternative ways
          of being, more socially just ways of being. In practice, this
          translates into campaigning for political prisoners in India,
          investigating land-rights movements, engaging with indigenous
          communities on concepts of stress, time and relationship to nature,
          and challenging the reticence to race education in American
          universities. Selected engagements are mentioned below:

          This conference brought together Scandinavian indigenous community
          (Sámi) together with indigenous communities from Jharkhand India. The talks and dialogues brought out similarities in
          historical colonization and forms of present day soft and/or direct
          violence experienced by the communities.
          Land rights (Fosen windmill case in Norway and Netarhat movement in
          India) and the meaning of solidarity were recurring themes around
          which discussions and exchange of histories took place throughout the
          conference.
