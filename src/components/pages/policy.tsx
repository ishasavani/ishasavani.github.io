          The European Corporate Sustainability Directive will require big
          companies ({'>'}1000 employees) to report on their sustainability
          practices, but what does sustainability actually mean? In this
          project, we will try to capture the concept of sustainability in
          quantitative (volumetric) and qualitative parameters with a case study
          based in Kenya- a semi-arid country which exports about 40% of world's
          cut-flowers. We hope to inform the Corporate Sustainability Directive
          through combining soil physics, geology and engagement with flower
          industry.

          We are re-visitng Europe's key legislation, the Water Framework
          Directive, and regulation EU Taxonomy and the Marine Strategy Framework directive to
          enable future management and equitable distribution of offshore and
          onshore deep groundwater resources that were not well known at the
          time of enactment of these laws and regulations.

          What kind of sources of water are available to humanity and nature,
          and what is the life of water as an economic commodity? The framing of
          economic regulations must take into account the climatic context and the 
          long term costs vs benefits of harvesting alternative water resources.

          Through the examination of circum-globular economic supply chains,
          history and memory of mining in Europe and Greenland, EU’s Critical
          Raw Material Act launched in 2023, is reviewed to reveal deeper
          meanings of “green” in the light of Europe’s energy transition
          ambitions.
