          The European Corporate Sustainability Directive will require big
          companies ({'>'}1000 employees) to report on their sustainability
          practices, but what does sustainability actually mean? In this
          project, we will try to capture the concept of sustainability in
          quantitative (volumetric) and qualitative parameters with a case study
          based in Kenya- a semi-arid country which exports a large amount of
          world's cut-flowers. We hope to inform the Corporate Sustainability
          Directive through combining soil physics, geology and engagement with
          flower industry.

          We are re-analyzing EU's transboundary maritime laws, water
          directives, climate law, and national and international water
          frameworks to enable equitable distribution and responsible management
          of offshore and onshore deep groundwater resources.

          What kind of sources of water are available to humanity and nature,
          and what is the life of water as an economic commodity? The framing of
          economic regulations must take into account sustainable water
          abstraction and historical time scales over which fresh water
          resources are replenished.

          Through the examination of circum-globular economic supply chains,
          history and memory of mining in Europe and Greenland, EU’s Critical
          Raw Material Act launched in 2023, is reviewed to reveal deeper
          meanings of “green” in the light of Europe’s energy transition
          ambitions.
