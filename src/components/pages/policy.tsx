          Pioneering water taxonomy using satellite data: the case of rose farming in semi-arid
          Kenya. The European corporate sustainability directive will require big companies (>1000 employees) to report on their sustainability practices. But what does sustaibability actually mean?

          Revisiting legal water water frameworks: We are re-analysing EU's
          transboundary maritime laws, water directives, climate law, and
          national and international water frameworks to enable equitable
          distribution and resposnible management of offshore and onshore deep
          groundwater resources.

          Economic policy and deep groundwater: What kind of sources of water
          are available to humanity and nature, and what is the life of water as
          an economic commodity? The framing of economic regulations must take
          into account sustainable water abstraction and historical time scales
          over which fresh water resources are replenished.

          Critical Raw Cartographies: Through the examination of circum-globular
          economic supply chains, history and memory of mining in Europe and
          Greenland, EU’s Critical Raw Material Act (2023) is reviewed to reveal
          deeper meanings of “green” in the light of Europe’s energy transition
          ambitions.
