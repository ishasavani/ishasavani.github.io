            Groundwater recharge estimates in the Horn of Africa.
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          Sustainability with regards to water can be divided into measurable
          parameters and qualitative indicators. Groundwater recharge is one
          such concrete parameter that refers to the fraction of rainfall that
          infiltrates the surface of the earth and contributes to the water
          table. It is thus indicative of the maximum volume of water that can
          be extracted without causing ecological imbalance (land subsidence,
          irreversible change in natural habitat).
          <br />
          Given the amount of water available for use, how much of this water is
          needed for the wellbeing of the community, of the non-human life, for
          industries? Sustainability thus implies striking a balance between
          various forms of water utilization in light of past, present and
          future water availability.

            Statistical characterization of extreme rainfall with a focus on
            semi-arid regions.
          </span>
          The distribution of extreme rainfall is marked by characteristic
          distributions such as the power-law and exponential type
          distributions. This project looks into drivers of extreme rainfall in
          semi arid regions of south Asia, while trying to construe the
          atmosphere as critical system that undergoes phase transitions,
          analogous to classical and quantum fields.

            Probabilistic interpretation of flow of two immiscible fluids (like
            water and oil or water and air) in millimeter scale pore spaces.{' '}
          </span>
          We explored systems in steady-state in which flow patterns form and
          break and the distribution of fluids in space changes in time in a way
          that that average characteristics of the system remain the same. In
          this way, time renders itself redundant and it becomes sufficient to
          understand the state of the system in terms of the configuration of
          fluids, rather than their path in time.

            On coupling between heat, charge and mass
          </span>
          The coupling between heat and charge is used to Thermomechanical
          expansion of silicon wafer under deep ultraviolet beam of light. This
          work looked into different configurations of giant photolithography
          machines with the aim to accurately predict the printing of “marks” on
          a silicon chip while the chip is expanding under the heat of DUV light
          and the different arms of the system are moving simultaneously.
