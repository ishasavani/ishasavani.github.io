            Groundwater recharge estimates of the Horn of Africa.

          <br />
          Sustainability with regards to water can be divided into measurable
          parameters and qualitative indicators. Groundwater recharge is one
          such concrete parameter that refers to the fraction of rainfall that
          infiltrates the surface of the earth and contributes to the water
          table. It is thus indicative of the maximum volume of water that can
          be extracted without causing ecological imbalance (land subsidence,
          irreversible change in natural habitat).
          <br />
          <br />
          Given the amount of water available for use, how much of this water is
          needed for the wellbeing of the community, of the non-human life, for
          industries? Sustainability thus implies striking a balance between
          various forms of water utilization in light of past, present and
          future water availability.

          The purpose of these simulations is to making sense of indications of

          water across several layers of the earth on geological time-scales.
          Current geographical focus is Eastern Horn of Africa and coastal
          Europe.

            Statistical characterization of extreme rainfall with a focus on
            semi-arid regions.

          <br />
          The distribution of extreme rainfall is marked by characteristic
          distributions such as the power-law and exponential type
          distributions. This project looks into drivers of extreme rainfall in
          semi arid regions of south Asia, while trying to construe the
          atmosphere as critical system that undergoes phase transitions,
          analogous to classical and quantum fields.

            Statistical Mechanics of flow of two immiscible fluids (like water
            and oil or water and air) in millimeter scale pore spaces
          </span>
          <br />
          <br />
          We explored physics of fluid transport at the pore-scale using
          steady-state simulations and theoretical investigation. The 2D pore
          network was analogous to a random-resistance network model.
          <br />
          Steady-state refers to the state in which channels of the two
          immiscible fluids form and break and the distribution of fluids in
          space changes with time in a way that average characteristics of the
          system remain the same. In this way, time renders itself redundant and
          it becomes sufficient to understand the state of the system in terms
          of the configuration (distribution of fluid bubbles), rather than
          their path in time.

            On the coupling between heat, charge and mass

          <br />
          Using simulations, coupling between heat and charge is used to measure
          thermo-mechanical expansion of silicon wafer under deep ultraviolet
          (DUV) beam of light. This work looked into different configurations of
          giant photolithography machines with the aim to accurately predict the
          time and position of “marks” being printed on a silicon chip by a DUV
          laser beam, while the chip is expanding under the heat of DUV light
          and the different parts of the system are, heating, cooling and moving
          simultaneously.

          <br />
          The thermodynamic coupling between heat and charge in Peltier
          elements, allows the conversion of heat to electricity in the presence
          of a temperature gradient. In this project, the flow of electric
          current is simulated in a thermoelectric generator (TEG) which is
          placed in the vicinity of a rotating carousel carrying molten silicon
          at a silicon production plant at Elkem Salten, Norway. We modelled the
          production of power as the TEG harnesses heat from this molten metal,
          thereby using waste heat for generating electricity.
